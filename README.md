Find out the secret number game developed in the program "Dev immersion" available and made by Alura, with duration of 1 week were made some projects with main focus on Javascrip and using some particularities of HTML and CSS.

In the game we have an input that the user can choose from number 0 to 10, the number is drawn just when the page starts and the game tells what was the number after the player tried 3 times.
